# Satisfy sample receipt page

This is a single page react app that takes the JSON from an imaginary API and displays an order status page. I considered all sorts of variations including some nice ternary operators and different icons depending on the statuses of the order. I did not modify any of the JSON so some of the thoughtful additions like "your order will arrive in x minutes" are saying your order will arrive 2 days ago. Styles and icons came from the Material UI project. I also used Moment.js and Michael Dwyer's Geo Helper's NPM package.
